    <h1>weekly k</h1>
    <p>End of the year post! This course has certainly been interesting. Overall I feel like I learned a lot though! I feel like I definitely slacked this semester in terms of the effort I was putting into the projects and exercises, but I wasn't doing it on purpose! I think it was more just with all the brain activity it took to learn coding, I didn't have much left for creativity, yknow? But I did my best, and I guess that's what is most important. Still, it kind of urks me that all my projects feel not quite completed; like with every one there's more that I wanted to do, I just didn't know how. Maybe I'll leave that up to the future; I hope to learn more about coding during my time at OSU, so hopefully I'll improve more over the years!<br><br>Thank you for joining me! This is Sabrina, signing off :]
