    <h1>weekly d</h1>
    <p>This is kind of late I'M SORRYYY. We're working on our websites now, I'm so intimidated by it lol. Like I know I'll be fine but I feel like there's still so much I don't know, I don't feel comfortable making a whole website yet, yknow? Like starting from scratch is TERRIFYING, maybe it's just my executive dysfunction talking though. It's these big projects that make me consider dropping out of art HAHA, like they stress me out more than they should.<br><br>This one is kind of short, sorry gamers. But please wish me luck in figuring this out.</p>
