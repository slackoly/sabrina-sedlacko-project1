    <p>Hullo it's me again. I got my discussion done last Friday (woo), so now all I have left for this class is the final. I'm gonna continue my haystacks painting, and hopefully add a bit of animation to it. I am. so ready for this class to be over lol. It just stresses me out so much more than it should, espescially the grading aspect. The most significant part to my grade right now is attendence, since all of the assignments are worth like 1 point. I'm usually good about being on time to class, it's just this stupid 3-times a week 8am schedule that keeps getting me. I swear I'm always running 10 minutes late, even when I wake up 10 minutes earlier. Hopefully I can evade any more early classes for the rest of my schedules. </p>
