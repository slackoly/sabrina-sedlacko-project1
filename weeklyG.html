    <h1>weekly g</h1>
    <p>WOooo it's almost April! We only have about a month left of the semester, thank god lol. I feel like I've had a really great year! Sure it had its moments, but overall I had a great time. I forget if I've talked about this already or not, but this summer I get to be the unit specialist for LITs at Camp Ernst! I'm really gonna miss Kern, but I'm excited for the new experiences and a change of scenery.<br><br>I'm not sure what I'm gonna do for my Exercise 5, if I'm being honest I haven't thought about it much. I think I definitely want to something much simpler than what I did for the last exercise lol. I genuinely worked on it all break and still only got a quarter of the way done with it. ALthough I think I am gonna finish it for my final, I really wanna see what it looks like finished! I also need to update my website too. Wish me luck!
