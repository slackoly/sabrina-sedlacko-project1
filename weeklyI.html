    <h1>weekly i</h1>
    <p>We are ALMOST DONE BABYYYYY. There's one week left of class then exam week, but I only have one exam on Friday so I basically have a free week. To pack ;-; ugh. I have a lot to do these next two weeks but I'm in the home stretch. We have formal on Saturday, so I'm really excited for that! I'm wearing my mom's dress, so it'll be a good time.<br><br>I got waitlisted for the two art classes I wanted to take and the big class for my game studies minor, so I had to get my schedule ironed out since I had too many stupid classes. I think I finally did it though! I'm taking first year english (finally), university band, rock wall climbing, craft of acting, photo 2, and hopefully moving image art since I'm number 1 on the waitlist. I also signed up to do my BFA portfolio review, so that'll be interesting for sure. Anyways, here's to the end of the year!
