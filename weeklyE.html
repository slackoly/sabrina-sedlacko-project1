    <p>It has certainly been an interesting week. James had the flu (rip) so they cancelled class all week. I wish I could say that I was productive and still went in and worked on my personal website (yknow, like an actual good student). But um. No. I did not do that. I don't know why it's so hard for me to be, like, a functional person. But I still feel like there's so much I don't know, and I'm not remotely creative enough to build a whole site. Hell, I still barely know where to begin. I'll finish it this week. I mean, I kind of have to. It is due Friday.<br><br>I really gotta grind this week. I have this project due, and an animation project due Tuesday. I'm also working out a job position for next summer, and I have a band concert on Thursday, and I'm working at camp this next weekend. AH I think I just need a week off.
